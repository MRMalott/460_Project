structures:
// card card_deck[81]
// card is a struct/class with 4 integers
// each signifying one of the card aspects
// this deck is predefined, these are basically
// the base cards to be referenced
card_deck [81]{int, int, int, int} 
// is basically to signify the card in card_deck
// if the deck is of type int 
//   the number signifies the card in card_deck
// if the deck is of type ptr to card
//   the card_deck array is made unecessary
//   can make the cards and point to them
shuffled_deck[81]{int|ptr}
// used to let the system know what cards 
// to display and where they are
// can either be the pointer to the cards 
// or the number to card_deck
